<h1>This Is Not a Small Voice

  This is not a small voice
  <br>
  you hear               this is a large
  <br>
  voice coming out of these cities.
  <br>
  This is the voice of LaTanya.
  <br>
  Kadesha. Shaniqua. This
  <br>
  is the voice of Antoine.
  <br>
  Darryl. Shaquille.
  <br>
  Running over waters
  <br>
  navigating the hallways
  <br>
  of our schools spilling out
  <br>
  on the corners of our cities and
  <br>
  no epitaphs spill out of their river mouths.<br>
  <br>
  
  This is not a small love
  <br>
  you hear               this is a large
  <br>
  love, a passion for kissing learning
  <br>
  on its face.
  <br>
  This is a love that crowns the feet with hands
  <br>
  that nourishes, conceives, feels the water sails
  <br>
  mends the children,
  <br>
  folds them inside our history where they
  <br>
  toast more than the flesh
  <br>
  where they suck the bones of the alphabet
  <br>
  and spit out closed vowels.
  <br>
  This is a love colored with iron and lace.
  <br>
  This is a love initialed Black Genius.<br>
  <br>
  
  This is not a small voice
  <br>
  you hear.

<h1>Hope.

<h2>
Alice Dunbar-Nelson - 1875-1935
</h2>
<p>
 Wild seas of tossing, writhing waves,
 <br>
 A wreck, half-sinking in the tortuous gloom;
 <br>
 One man clings desperately, while Boreas raves,
 <br>
 And helps to blot the rays of moon and star,
 <br>
 Then comes a sudden flash of light which gleams on shores
 <br>
 afar.

  What Is Water?

</h1>
<h2>
  Danielle Legros Georges
</h2>
<p>
What is water but rain but cloud but river but ocean 
<br>
but ice but tear.
<br>
<br>What is tear but torn what is worn as skin as in as out
<br>as out.
<br>
<br>Exodus. I am trying to tell a tale that shifts like a gale
<br>that hurricanes and casts a line
<br>
<br>that buckles in wind that is reborn a kite a wing. 
<br>I am far
<br>
<br>from the passage far from the plane of descending
<br>them,
<br>
<br>suitcases passports degrees of mobility like heat 
<br>like heat on their backs.
